# Face-Mask-Detection-using-Machine-learning-algorithms
This repository shows the work done in my master thesis using machine learning algorithms which became essential in our daily life and how it can be used to make life easier. The data for Face mask detection model was collected and pre-processed to be ready to be used then, a model was created and tested on several pre-trained neural networks like ResNet, VGG, DenseNet and YOLO and every one of them have achieved different results after several tuning and testing for each neural network. Observing the loss and accuracy with comparing accuracy and validation accuracy for every neural network to know which one performed well also, another test was made using webcam to test the model with different type of masks with different faces to test the model.
